I am a Research Scientist (Machine Learning) at [Google AR/VR](https://arvr.google.com/). My research interests span the broad areas of performance capture, animation, neural rendering, generative models, and deep learning. I generally enjoy working on creative applications at the intersection of computer vision, graphics, and machine learning. Please take a look at some of my [publications](/publications/) to know more about my work :)

Previously I was an Associate Research Scientist at [Disney Research\|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) and a member of the [Facial VFX group](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/digital-humans/). I completed my PhD from the [Computer Graphics Lab](https://cgl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich and [Disney Research\|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/), where I was advised by [Prof. Markus Gross](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.mgross.html), and  co-supervised by [Dr. Derek Bradley](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/people/derek-bradley/). Before my PhD, I completed my Masters in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology](https://ee.ethz.ch/), also at ETH Zurich, where my focus was on machine learning and computer vision. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering in 2013 from the [Madras Institute of Technology](https://www.annauniv.edu/) and later worked for 3 years at [Caterpillar Inc.](https://www.caterpillar.com/) as an embedded electronics engineer.
